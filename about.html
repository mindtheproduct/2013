	    <h4>MindTheProduct 2013 is brought to you by a team of four product managers who spend all day building start-ups, and all night building a community for other product managers.</h4>
	    <p><a href="#">Martin</a> founded <a href="#">ProductTank</a>, a monthly product management meet up in London, which has been running for two years and now has over 900 members in the group and gets 120+ attendees at every meetup.</p>
	
	    <p>Janna and Simon co-founded ProductCamp London bi-annually - a collaborative, user organized unconference based on the global ProductCamp.org.</p>
	
	    <p>Together with Sam we got together and founded MindtheProduct.com, a blog focused on product management, which we define as the intersection between design, technology and business. The blog combines our own editorial with community contributed posts.</p>
	
	    <p>We are a not for profit company, funded by our generous sponsors and ticket sales, and driven by a passion for great products and the people who build them.</p>
